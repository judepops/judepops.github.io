🎓 I have recently completed my Master's in Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology at Imperial College London and I am currently working at Nucleome Therapeutics on a 6-month placement.

🧬 My primary research interests are in multi-omics anlaysis and gene expression regulation. 

🏢 Having developed a strong research portfolio during my Undergraduate degree in Biochemisty and Master's degree in Bioinformatics, I am currnently utilising my robust biological foundation and diverse computational skillset to contribute to early stages in development of Nucleome's drug discovery pipeline. 

# Selected Skills

## Multi-Omics
- skill 1
- skill 2 




## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.
